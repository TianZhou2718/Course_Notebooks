This course is the sequence about the general theory of PDEs. The beginning of the course will describe several important results of functional analysis which are instrumental for the study of PDEs: Hahn-Banach theorem, Uniform boundedness and closed graph theorems, reflexive spaces and weak topologies. The topics covered include: theory of Sobolev spaces. Harmonic functions and their properties. Weyl theorem. General Elliptic operators. Existence theory for elliptic boundary value problems. Lax-Milgram theorem. Dirichlet principle. Fine properties of solutions of elliptic equations such as maximum principles, Harnack principles, Sobolev and Hölder regularity.
