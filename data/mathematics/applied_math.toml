descriptions = ["""
A course on computational linear algebra and applications. Topics include floating-point arithmetic algorithms and convergence Gaussian elimination for linear systems matrix decompositions (LU, Cholesky, QR) iterative methods for systems (Jacobi, Gauss Seidel) approximation of eigenvalues (power method, QR-algorithm) and also singular values and singular-value decomposition (SVD). Theoretical topics such as vector spaces, inner products norms, linear operators, matrix norms, eigenvalues and canonical forms of matrices (Jordan, Schur) are reviewed as needed.
